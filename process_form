In the PHP code above, we first create a new PDO object to connect to the local database. 
We then use the $_POST superglobal array to get the form data submitted by the user. 
We prepare a SQL statement to insert the data into the customers table in the database, and bind the form data to the appropriate placeholders in the statement using the bindParam method.
We then execute the SQL statement, and redirect the user to a confirmation page.

Note that you will need to create a database with a customers table that has columns for email, idno, name, password, and region. 
You will also need to modify the PDO connection string to match your local database configuration.
