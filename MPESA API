So I wanted to create a checkout system that is supposed to be integrated with M-PESA API, how can I integrate it into my website(create a html checkout page and integrate the API to my system)

To integrate M-PESA API with your website's checkout system, you will need to follow these steps:

    Sign up for an account with M-PESA API. This will give you access to their documentation and test environment.

    Create a checkout form on your website that collects the customer's payment details (e.g. phone number, amount to be paid, etc.).

    Use the M-PESA API documentation to generate an authentication token and initiate a new payment transaction with the details collected from the checkout form. You can use PHP to make the API request.

    Once the API confirms the success of the transaction, update your local database with the details of the transaction (e.g. transaction ID, status, etc.) and show a confirmation page to the customer.

Here is an example HTML checkout form that collects the necessary information:
